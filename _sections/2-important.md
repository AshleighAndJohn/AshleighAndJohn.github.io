Rule number one is that you wear whatever will make you comfortable. That said, please keep a few things in mind:

#### The ground is grass and can be uneven
   * This means please don't wear high heels
   * Bring them for the dance floor if you want, but flats are strongly encouraged for walking the grounds.

#### There will be port-a-potties
 * I know, we wanted it differently too, but the septic could not possibly handle the guest list and we are *not* going to test it.

#### It'll be in the 60s once the sun goes down
   * No matter how hot it was during the day
   * Please bring layers, especially if you plan to stay late

#### There wil probably be mosquitos at/after sunset
 * We'll do as much as we can to mitigate this, but if you plan to stay late please bring layers
