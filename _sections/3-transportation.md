#### Driving
The farm is ~70 miles north of Seattle via I-5 and it usually takes about 90 minutes to get to the farm from downtown Seattle. That said, travel times in the area can vary wildly! So please pay attention to traffic on the day of the event.

#### Car pooling
Indicate in the RSVP if you'd like to car pool and we'll connect all of the people who are interested in this option.

#### Bus/Train
You can Amtrak or bus to Mount Vernon, but you'll still be ~5 miles from the farm. If you want to go this route please be sure to coordinate a pickup from the station or bring your bike!

#### Parking
My parents joke that they have $1,000,000 worth of parking, and there is indeed a lot of space, but we'll be asking folks who are sufficiently able bodied to park in the back 40 and walk up so that our elders can park closer. When you get close there will be family/friends tasked with flagging down vehicles are routing you to the right place.
