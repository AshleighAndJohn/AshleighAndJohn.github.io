#### Driving
It usually takes about 90 minutes to get to the farm from downtown Seattle. That said, travel times in the area can vary wildly! So please pay attention to traffic on the day of the event.

#### Car pooling
Please do this, there is a lot of parking at the farm but it isn't infinite.

#### Parking
There will be folks flagging you down and directing you where to park. Close parking is reserved for campers, elders, or anybody else who can't manage the walk from the parking field.
