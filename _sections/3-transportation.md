#### Driving
It usually takes about 80 minutes to get to the farm from downtown Seattle. That said, travel times in the area can vary wildly! So please pay attention to traffic on the day of the event.

#### Car pooling
Indicate in the RSVP if you'd like to car pool and we'll connect all of the people who are interested in this option.

#### Parking
There will be folks flagging you down and directing you where to park. Close parking is reserved for campers and elders who can't manage the 1/4 mile walk from the back 40.
