### Camping info:
**For campers with kids:** There is a fully fenced very large grassy yard that is away from the dance floor and late night noise that is all for you. In addition to the port-a-potties you will also have access to the restroom just inside the house if you need that for your kiddos. You may setup camp as soon as you arrive if you wish, you will also be able to park very nearby.

**For campers *without* kids:** You have two choices, my parents have a large yard that is also away from the late night noise. Alternatively you can camp up near the dance floor where the fun is. If you choose the yard you may setup as soon as you arrive if you wish, if you'd like to be where the party is at you won't be able to setup camp until just after the ceremony (because you'll be setting up your tent in the same space as the ceremony chairs). 

**Late night food:** We'll have snacks and catering leftovers but we definitely invite you to bring your own late night favorite snacks. There will be an abundance of fruit and veggies (because Ashleigh) but if you need Taquito's or Mountain Dew to keep going please bring your own supply :D

### Morning after Brunching info:
Brunch preparations will likely not commence until after 10am, if you need to be up and out before then that's totally fine but we won't be able to feed you. For reference, we are expecting approximately 50 people for brunch.

**What we'll have:** Vegan (highly glutinous, sorry) pancakes, bacon, coffee, blackberries

**What we need:** If you can bring a coffee maker or an electric griddle let us know (we have two 12-cup coffee makers and two electric griddles, but more would be good)

**What you can bring:** juice (or other breakfast drink you like), fruit, gluten-free baked goods, eggs if you have a way to cook them (we know it's a popular breakfast food, but they are also death to John).
