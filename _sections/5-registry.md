Your presence is the best present! But since people are asking:

### <i class="fa fa-gift" aria-hidden="true"></i> Registry? `No`
We don't have a registry because we are already blessed with an abundance of things.

### <i class="fa fa-paw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Live animals? `Hmmmm, maybe`

### Are you going to let us have any fun? `Yes!`
We love experiences, foods, and drinks. That means things like:
 * An in-kind charitable donation
 * Gift cards to restaurants
 * Theatre tickets or other cultural events
 * Awesome beverages (beer, rum, scotch)
 * Plants and seeds (flowers, vegetables, a tree!)
 * Things that you made by hand
 * Dancing with us at the wedding
