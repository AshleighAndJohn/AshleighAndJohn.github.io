We've got the snacks, but please remember to pack everything you'll need to be comfortable:
 - tent
 - sleeping bag
 - sleeping pad (or inflatable mattress)
 - pillow
 - change of clothes
 - toothbrush?

### <i class="fa fa-bed" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hotels
There are hotels in the area, but we don't have any specific recommendations at this time.

### <i class="fa fa-shower" aria-hidden="true"></i> AirBnB
There are some [interesting looking AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Sedro-Woolley--WA--United-States/homes?checkin=2018-08-18&checkout=2018-08-19&adults=2&children=0&infants=0&guests=2&place_id=ChIJC-e-3ZcIhVQRwYMWIpg7w0c&query=Sedro-Woolley%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&source=mc_search_bar&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&allow_override%5B%5D=&s_tag=FSSAyOtQ) options in the area if camping and hotels aren't your jam.

We can't endorse anything in particular, but [wow look at this](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22084014?location=Sedro%20Woolley%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&adults=2&children=0&infants=0&guests=2&check_in=2018-08-18&check_out=2018-08-19&s=FSSAyOtQ)!
