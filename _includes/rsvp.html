                    We love gifts, but if you've been in our house you know how much (too much) stuff we already have. If you <i>haven't</i> been in our house, just imagine a level 1 hoarder. It's getting serious, but not a health risk yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which means that while we welcome any and all gifts you want to give us we do ask that you lean on the side of consumables or experiences. And really the best experience you could give us would be to come and dance at our wedding!
